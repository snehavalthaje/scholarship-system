        <h1>About Our Scholarship System</h1>

        <p>
            Every year, thousands of students apply for various scholarships from different segments of society.
            At the same time, there are a large number of eligible students who do not apply for these scholarships 
            due to a lack of awareness or because the application process is inaccessible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scholarships are a means to enable deserving students to pursue education that might otherwise 
            be beyond their reach. They encourage students to study well and serve as a strong motivation to 
            perform even better.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most universities and governments offer multiple scholarships across various segments. 
            These scholarships may be based on academic excellence, sports achievements, vocational courses, 
            or performing arts. Each of these contributes to making students feel empowered, supported, 
            and financially stable.
